# POWER-ONðŸ¤–
**POSTECH** Undergraduate Student Robot Club

POWER-ON, founded in 1991, started as a robot-football club and now creates robots and carries out various maker projects.

Nowadays, we make robots reflecting current technological trends, like robots combined with a smart kiosk or robots with autonomous driving technology based on AI. We also do some carpentry or 3d printing works just for fun.

We aim to establish a club where members can openly "make" and communicate about their works.
